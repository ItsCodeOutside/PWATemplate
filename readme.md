# PWA Template

This is my simple Progressive Web App template, it is an easy start to creating a small JAVAScript web application that visitors can install on their devices to view offline.

## To Do
1. Remove bootstrap.
   - [✔] Set the fonts I like
   - Set styles:
      - [✔] Links
      - Form elements
   - [✔] Set colour scheme as vars
   - [✔] Remove bootstrap CSS & JS

2. [✔] Update footer to gently display install option.

3. Show install option in menu if not already installed.

4. Come up with a scheme for CRUD content control.

5. Set up GitHub actions for minify
